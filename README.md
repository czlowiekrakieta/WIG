crawler I created some time ago in order to extract fundamental data about Warsaw Stock Exchange - a lot of room for improvement, though. naive usage of Random Forest returned accuracy of 99%, but I have yet to find what I missed...

Notes to self:
- bind all scripts to one single file
- perform more sophisticated analysis of dataset
- make more features - every vector should contain something about company's past, relative change of every financial indicator at the very least
- do something about splits - find adjusted data or get rid of them on your own
- translate scripts to english
- there's a lot of missing data of stock movement, got to find better source of them
