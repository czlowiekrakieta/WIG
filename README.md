crawler I created some time ago in order to extract fundamental data about Warsaw Stock Exchange - a lot of room for improvement, though. Naive Machine Learning with no exploratory analysis turned out to return 60% accuracy in predicting whether stock will beat the market or not

Notes to self:
- bind all scripts to one single file
- perform more sophisticated analysis of dataset
- make more features - every vector should contain something about company's past, relative change of every financial indicator at the very least
- do something about splits - find adjusted data or get rid of them on your own
